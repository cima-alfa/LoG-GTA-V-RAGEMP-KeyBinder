# Keybinder for Life of German GTA V RP Server

Built using AHK v1.1

## Features:
- Keybinds, loops and commands with multiline text support
- Search for a specific image on screen and click on button (automatic healing)
- - Works for specific resolutions only
- Custom variables usable in texts
- Ability to turn on / off keybinder without shutting down the application
- Ability to stop active loops (including multiline texts)
- AFK Timer
- Autoupdate and patch notes (Currently disabled since server no longer works)

## Bugs
- For some reason German encoding no longer works
- - Since the server is no longer active, I won't be fixing that

### Antivirus

- For the compiled exe file, it might be necessary to make an antivirus exception
